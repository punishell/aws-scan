## Features

The scanner checks for security misconfigurations across many AWS services, including:

### Critical Severity Issues
- Lack of root MFA
- Presence of root access keys

- RDS instances publicly accessible
- EBS snapshots publicly restorable
- AWS Config not enabled
- Public AMIs owned by your account

### High Severity Issues
- Multi-Region CloudTrail missing
- SSH/RDP exposed to 0.0.0.0/0
- IAM Access Analyzer disabled
- RDS automatic minor upgrades disabled
- Account not in AWS Organizations
- CloudFront distributions without HTTPS
- ELB/ALB without HTTPS configured
- Lambda functions with public access

### Medium Severity Issues
- IAM access keys not rotated â‰¤ 90 days
- Weak IAM password policy
- CloudTrail KMS encryption disabled
- IMDSv1 still allowed
- VPC Flow Logs disabled
- S3 encryption disabled
- S3 bucket versioning not enabled
- S3 bucket logging not enabled
- RDS storage not encrypted
- GuardDuty disabled
- ELB/ALB with insecure SSL/TLS policies
- KMS key rotation not enabled
- Lambda functions without VPC configuration
- DynamoDB tables without encryption
- DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery disabled
- AWS Shield Advanced not enabled
- EBS encryption by default not enabled

### Low Severity Issues
- Missing resource tags
- CloudTrail log validation disabled
- S3 lifecycle policies missing
- Default security group allows traffic

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- AWS credentials with read-only permissions for the services to be scanned

## Setup

1. Make sure the AWS CLI is installed and configured with the account you want to scan:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```

2. Make the script executable:
   ```
   chmod +x aws_security_scanner.py
   ```

## Usage

Simply run the script:

```
./aws_security_scanner.py
```

The script will check each security configuration and:
1. Display issues found in the terminal, grouped by severity
2. Generate a detailed HTML report with findings, including:
   - Finding name and severity
   - Detailed description
   - CLI commands for verification
   - Potential impact
   - Remediation recommendations

The HTML report will automatically open in your default web browser after the scan completes.

## Report Example

The HTML report provides comprehensive information about each finding:

* **Finding details**: Clear description of the issue
* **CLI Command**: AWS CLI commands you can run to verify the finding
* **Impact**: Explanation of the security risks associated with the finding
* **Recommendation**: Specific steps to remediate the issue
